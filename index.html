Hi! My name is Peilin Li, or you can just call me Ross (Ross from FRIENDS!). <br/>

I am a software engineer with a passion for building web applications. <br/>
I am currently a student at the George Washington University, pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems Technology. <br/>
I am also going to be a teaching assistant for the introductory computer science course. <br/>

I am also building and promoting split ergonomic keyboards. <br/>
